# Devtober2024
Welcome to our efforts in developing a game over the month of Octover. The reuirements are loose and mostly self-imposed. Just work on it, post about it if you want to. As of writingt this I have no idea what this game will be, but I'm putting together as much as I can to make sure collaboration can happen.

## How to get started in Godot
First download Godot 4.3 https://godotengine.org/download/windows/
It should be the most recent version. There is not "installation" for godot, so you will either have to know where you put it OR register it under "open as" when you click project.godot file.
On that note, you can download the repository and I beleive opening project.exe in the resulting folder with the "Godot_v4.3-stable_win64.exe" godot file SHOULD open the project and give you the appropriate ".godot" folder needed for everything to function.

## How to get started in git (version control)
Well you are here, so thats a good start. You can pick watever client you like for version control, but if you unfamiliar i suggest one with a graphic user interface. I personally use GitKraken. You can use Git For Windows or whatever works for you. Version control is its own skill, so we will use it in the simplest form:

First and foremost before start working make a new "branch" to work on. Just name it with your "dev-" and then your initals or some unique name or whatever. For example I'll be working in "dev-jv". Once you have your branch you can work on files and etc, and when you want to "save" your work to the repository, you can "commit" it. That will save the stat of the project on your computer. If you want to save it to the internet for the rest of us, you "push" your commits. When you think everything you have is "Working" you can ask me and I will "merge" your changes into the "main" branch.

The idea is that the "main" branch is the most stable function version of the game, while we all work on our own thing on our own "dev-" branches. You can have multiple other branches if you want and name them whatever you want if you perfer to separate what feature your working on, and then you can merge them into your main "dev-" branch when you are ready to test and then share with main. For example I mean make a branch "jv-concept-art" and i'll put my art and sketches in there so i have them all backed up and i have a history of changes and etc, and when i want to share, I will "merge" it into "dev-jv"

This is a lot for newcompers to git so just ask if you have questions or what to do things another way and I'll try to accomodate you. If you really want, you can send my all the files and I'll merge them in, its just more time and effort on my part. Version control is a valuable tool and very worthwhile knowing how to use it though, in just about every job, so i higly suggest getting familiarity.
